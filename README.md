# 4d minesweeper

4d minesweeper made for the terminal

## How to play

You have to find all the mines in a 4 dimensional field. The pink cursor highlights the current field you're on and its value shows the number of bombs that are around it. To help you find which fields are in the area of influence of the cursor, they are highlighted in a less saturated shade of pink. Have fun finding all the mines!

> [!WARNING]
> This program may run into a segmentation fault in the year 10000. This is due to the fact, that the `save_game_to_file` function has a fixed length for the file name

## Compiling and running

To compile the program, simply run:

```
gcc main.c mtwister.c -lm -o 4dminsweeper
```

> [!WARNING]
> This program was made for Linux, i doubt that it would work on windows

> [!TIP]
> If you want to try it on windows, you could try using [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/). (I have not tested this, I don't know if it will work...)

> [!WARNING]
> This program was only tested on Arch Linux!
> According to this [issue](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1662909/undefined-reference-to-pthread-create-in-linux), you have to add `-pthread` on Ubuntu systems e.g.: `gcc main.c mtwister.c -lm -pthread -o 4dminsweeper
`

To run the program, simply type:

```
./4dminesweeper
```

> [!WARNING]
> Make sure your terminal is big enough!!!

There are a few extra options you could add, if you don't want to edit the settings while the game is running

<pre>
  -h, -?, --help         Show this menu
  -d, --do_random        If true, sets the seed to the current time
  -s, --seed             Input seed as an unsigned integer
  -b, --bombs            Input amount of bombs as an unsigned integer
  -r, --recursion_depth  The amount of recursion allowed when uncovering fields
  -a, --area, --size     Size of the game (must be given as a list of unsigned integers e.g.: -a 4 4 4 4)
  -i, --show_info        Show info about the current game. Can be set to true or false
  -u, --show_delta       Field numbers only show unmarked bombs instead of the total amount. Can be set to true or false
  -g, --debug            Run in debug mode. Allows editing of field contents
  -l, --load             Load game from save file (currently not implemented)
</pre>

> [!TIP]
> When running the program in debug mode, make sure to send the error messages somewhere else by appending `2> [file descriptor]` to the command e.g.: `./4dminesweeper -g 2> error.txt`

> [!TIP]
> To send the error messages to a different terminal, go to said terminal and type `tty`. This will return something like `/dev/pts/[number]` (e.g.: `/dev/pts/2`). Now you have the _file descriptor_ of that terminal. You can use `2>` to send everything that is printed to standard error, to whatever you put after it (e.g.: the _file descriptor_ of a terminal: `./4dminesweeper -g 2> /dev/pts/2`). (For your information: I still consider myself a Linux noob. I am pretty sure all the information I have provided is correct. Please do your own research! A good place to start is the [Arch wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org) or any of the many Linux forums)

## TODO

- [x] Delta mode: decrement surrounding numbers when bomb is marked
- [x] Big numbers: currently i don't know what will happens if a field has a 3 digit number
- [ ] Fix timer: currently the timer only updates when you move, idk how to fix it
- [x] Add keyboard shortcut for toggling info
- [ ] Make keyboard shortcuts customisable
- [ ] Add config file
- [ ] Write installer
- [ ] Add scrolling to the 4d field
- [ ] Make info display on top of the game
- [ ] Assume field size of 1 when user gives less than 4 integers for option -a, --area or --size
- [x] Make field shrink after numbers change
- [ ] Graphical bug in cursor's area of influence when unpausing
- [ ] Graphical bug with timer, prints to random x position sometimes
- [ ] Graphical bug with timer, only prints partially
- [ ] Graphical bug with flags after unpausing
- [ ] Graphical bug when starting the game: flied with the wrong colour
> [!NOTE]
> I believe that most of the graphical bugs are caused by the fact, that the timer runs on a second thread but is editing the same terminal. The reason I have decided to do it this way, is because of the function `getchar()` and how it occupies the main thread, until a character is inputted. I have ideas on how to fix this, but am not sure if they will work or if I will be able to muster up the motivation to implement them (I get distracted very easily. That's why I keep adding new features/to-dos and keep ignoring old bugs (unless they're actively irritating me...))
- [x] Sometimes there is a graphical bug when chording
- [x] Marking field on game over reveals entire field
- [x] Hide field when paused
- [x] Start timer on first key press
- [x] Add option to reveal field when game is over
- [x] Make time minutes and seconds
- [ ] Make uncover field work better in delta mode
- [x] Show 0 in delta mode when there are covered fields in its area of influence
- [x] Find better colours for the cursor. I will not accept any colour other than pink!
- [x] Sometimes field turns wide randomly
- [x] Timer disappears after new game
- [x] Implement chording for uncovering fields
- [ ] Improve chording for uncovering fields
- [x] Implement chording for marking fields
- [x] Change terminal title to 4d minesweeper
- [x] Save game state
- [x] Restore game from save file
- [ ] Make saving and restoring actually accessible
- [ ] Add SQL database to track statistics, cause fun, probably
- [ ] Add tutorial
- [ ] Make debug mode able to edit mask and delta instead of just grid and make input of negative numbers possible
